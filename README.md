## 🎯 Problem Statement

The current event ticketing industry faces several critical challenges:

1. **Extreme Price Scalping**: Authentic tickets are being resold at drastically inflated prices (e.g., Coldplay tickets originally priced at ₹5,000 being resold for ₹1,50,000).

2. **Widespread Fraud**: Approximately 25% of people globally have been scammed while attempting to purchase resale tickets.

3. **High Platform Fees**: Traditional platforms charge substantial fees on every ticket sale, creating financial burden for both organizers and attendees.

- **Organizer Staking**: 0.1 ETH stake requirement ensuring accountability
